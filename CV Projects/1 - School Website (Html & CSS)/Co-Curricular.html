<h1>EVENTS</h1>
<h2>Republic Day</h2>
<img src="images/republic.jpg" align="left" width="300" height="225">
<p>Republic Day is a national holiday in India, when the country marks and celebrates the date on which the Constitution of 
India came into effect on 26, January 1950, replacing the Government of India Act (1935) as the governing document of 
India and thus, turning the nation into a newly formed republic.[1] The day also marks the transition of India from an 
autonomous Commonwealth realm with British Monarch as nominal head of the Indian Dominion, to a fully sovereign republic 
in the Commonwealth of Nations with the President of India as the nominal head of the Indian Union.</p>
<p>In view of this, the School will be closed for all students and staff and classes are cancelled. No extra classes will 
be conducted as compensation</p>
